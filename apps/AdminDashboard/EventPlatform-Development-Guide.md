# 🎉 Event Platform Development Guide

## 📌 Overview

This guide outlines the step-by-step development process for three interconnected systems:

- **EventMingle**: Social event discovery and interaction platform
- **EventManager**: Comprehensive professional event planning and execution suite
- **Master Admin Dashboard**: Unified admin control center for both platforms

All platforms are fully integrated and support login with Google (OAuth 2.0).

---

## 🚪 Step 1: Authentication & Login System

### 🔐 Technologies
- Firebase Authentication or NextAuth.js (recommended for SSR apps)
- OAuth 2.0 with Google Sign-In
- JWT for secure sessions
- Optional: Biometric/MFA support

### 💻 UI Features
- Email/password login
- Google Sign-in button
- Forgot password & reset link
- Role-based redirect (User/Admin)

### 🧠 Implementation
1. Configure Firebase/NextAuth with Google OAuth
2. Create login/signup forms
3. Create server-side session handler using JWT
4. Save user roles and metadata in PostgreSQL
5. Redirect user to EventMingle, EventManager, or Admin Dashboard based on role
